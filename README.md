# Technical-Documentation
If you have a little bit of knowledge of Javascript then you can create a webpage of technical documentation. It requires knowledge of HTML, CSS and basic javascript. 

Divide the whole webpage into two sections. The left side creates a menu with all the topics listed from top to bottom. Right side you need to mention the documentation or description for the topics. 

The idea is once you click on one of the topics in the left section it should load the content on the right. 

For click, you can use either javascript or CSS bookmark option. You donâ€™t need to make it too fancy, just give it a simple and decent look, that looks good for technical documentation.
